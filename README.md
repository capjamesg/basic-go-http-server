# Go HTTP Web Server

A simple HTTP server built with sockets in Go.

This server only supports HTTP requests. I wrote this server to help me learn Go. This codebase is not suitable for production use.

## Getting Started

To run the server, execute the following command:

    go run server/server.go

This will start the server at `localhost:8080`.

To make a request to the server, run:

    go run sockets.go
